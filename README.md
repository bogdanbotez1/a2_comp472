How to run the code:

1. Open A2_comp472_40077707 with jupyter notebook
2. For 3x3,4x4,5x5, the MOVE FUNCTIONS have to be ran at first to not cause any errors such as this function does not exist,
3. Every single algorithm is made in a single cell and will work just by running it. 
4. To change the puzzle or run multiple just change the numbers in the function calls.

for instance "Depth_First_Search(((6, 2, 1), (7, 8, 3), (5, 4, 9)))" is running DPS with a start with the tupple ((6, 2, 1), (7, 8, 3), (5, 4, 9))
